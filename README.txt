****************************************

Unitec Corporate is a fluid-width, three-
column theme for Moodle 2.2.

NB: While the theme is for Moodle 2.2,
the version.php file contains the information
for lowering this requirement. Theme has not
been tested in 2.0 or 2.1, so doing so is
currently at your own risk. My aim is to have
this theme fully compatible with all versions
of Moodle 2.
